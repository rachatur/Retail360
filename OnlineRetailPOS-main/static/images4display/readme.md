# Directory Usage

This folder/directory is used for storing images for customer facing screen display. I have added two photos for examplse, so one can see how it looks. Main purpose of this is that, one can add as many customized images of products, prices, promotions as well as advertising images. Django will automaticly read this folder when ever the customer screen page is refreshed and try to randomly show images in loop until page is closed.

You can just add or delete pictures directly from this folder, however, if you are running docker container, you will have make changes to the images4display folder within the conatiner.

In future I may think of adding UI to do this from web app directly through some sort forms, where you can upload images to directly from the app.
